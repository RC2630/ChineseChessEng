# ChineseChessEng

This is a program that allows 2 players to fight against each other in Chinese Chess! Import this repository into [Replit](https://replit.com/) for a multiplayer experience! To get started, type `/help` after you run the program to learn how to move pieces on the board, as well as use special commands. In this version of the program, the piece names are always displayed in English, rather than the more expected Chinese, due to technical difficulties. There is also a [Windows-specific version](https://github.com/RC2630/ChineseChess) of this program that can be run in [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/), which (on some devices) can display the piece names in Chinese.

Current status: COMPLETE (all core gameplay, user interface, special command, and move validity checking logic implemented)
